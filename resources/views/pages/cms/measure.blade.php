				<p>Size does matter when it comes to buying wallpaper for your home or office because:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>You would not want to buy extra rolls which have no use and lie stacked around.</li>
				<li>You do not want to fall short of rolls to cover your entire wall.</li>
				<li>You do not want tacky work with frayed wallpaper sticking out at the corners.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Therefore, once you have zeroed down on the design, the next step is to measure the size of wallpaper you would require to cover up your walls in an aesthetic way.</p>
				
				<p>In order to measure your wallpaper, you have to consider what you require:</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li>Full wall covering for high impact and best value for money.</li>
				<li>Partial wall covering for adding a certain theme to smaller spaces.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p></p><h4>For Full Wall Coverings</h4><p></p>
				<ul>
				<li><b>Width</b> - Measure the horizontal distance of the wall, from corner to corner.</li>
				<li><b>Height</b>&nbsp;– Measure the vertical height at each corner of the wall. Some walls are not perfectly square. If there is a difference in height, always select the greater of the two height measurements.</li>
				</ul>

				<p></p><h4>For Partial Wall Coverings</h4><p></p>
				<p>Make registration marks along the area that you want to cover.</p>
				
				<ul>
				<li><b>Width</b> - Measure the horizontal distance between registration marks.</li>
				<li><b>Height</b>&nbsp;– Measure the vertical height at each corner of the registration mark. You may want to cover a variety of heights. In case of difference in height, always select the greater of the two height measurements.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="text-center"> <img src="Images/width-height1.png" alt=""></p>
				<p>Most wallpaper designs are pretty flexible and trimming the edges to achieve a perfect finish does not harm the overall look. Always use a measuring tape to get the most accurate measurement. Finally, add a few extra inches along the sides of your wallpaper. This will give you a little breathing space in case of any odd mistakes!
